This is the first patch release for the `containerd` 1.1 release. This
includes bug fixes related to runtime, CRI, image pull, and native snapshotter.

## Runtime
Fix race condition in TTY console

## CRI Plugin
Fixes for working set memory calculation, privileged container creation and
image volume directory ownership.
Fix a bug that container running as non-root will get capabilities added by
user. This is fixed to keep the behavior consistent with Docker.
Fix double mount of /dev/shm.
Fix startup panic when overlayfs fails to load, now cri plugin will just fail.

## Image Pull
Fix for a size validation bug with some registries which impacts the
CRI plugin and clients.

## Native Snapshotter
Fix for bug in layers containing large files.

Please see the changelog for full details.
