preface = """\
This is the fourth patch release for the `containerd` 1.1 release. This
release includes several fixes in both the CRI plugin and containerd
behavior as more real-world testing is occurring on containerd-based
Kubernetes clusters.

Containerd now handles a large number of layers using the overlayfs
snapshotter properly. Also, supplemental GIDs found in `/etc/groups` for
the running user are added to the OCI spec "additionalGids" array.

The additional GIDs change and also setting `HOSTNAME` in the environment
of containers running in a pod are both fixed in this release, matching
expected Docker engine behavior.

## Containerd
Fix a potential content store bug, backported from 1.2

## CRI Plugin
Add `HOSTNAME` to container default environment. Add additional GIDs for
running container user to the OCI spec. Fixed an issue that a directory
mount can override sub-directory mount. Fixed an issue that a container
can't be stopped when container processes are accidentally moved out of
container cgroups. Fix an issue that invalid SELinux format is not
rejected.

## ctr
Add a `--allow-new-privs` flag on `ctr run` to allow testing an OCI spec
that does not set `NoNewPrivileges` on by default.

## Overlayfs Snapshotter
Supports > 128 layers properly.

Please see the changelog for full details.
