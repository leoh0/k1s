preface = """\
This is the first patch release for the `containerd` 1.1 release. This
includes bug fixes related to CRI, image pull, and native snapshotter.

## CRI Plugin
Fixes for working set memory calculation, privileged container creation and
image volume directory ownership.
Fix a bug that container running as non-root will get capabilities added by
user. This is fixed to keep the behavior consistent with Docker.

## Image Pull
Fix for a size validation bug with some registries which impacts the
CRI plugin and clients.

## Native Snapshotter
Fix for bug in layers containing large files.

Please see the changelog for full details.
