preface = """\
This is the third patch release for the `containerd` 1.1 release. This
release includes a new config option in CRI plugin and several bug fixes
in containerd client, ctr and native snapshotter.

Containerd now sets gid to 0 if it is not specified. This matches the docker
behavior. The change was applied to containerd client, `ctr` and CRI plugin.

## CRI Plugin
Add `no_pivot` config option. It is useful when running containerd on
ramdisk.

## ctr
Fix a bug in `ctr run` that the `--no-pivot` and `--rootfs` flags are missing.

## Native Snapshotter
Fix a bug in the native snapshotter that the permission bits of `/`
is set to `0700` unexpectedly. It is now set to `0755`.

Please see the changelog for full details.
